# Community Tutorials

## About the Community Engagement Efforts

Here you will find a collection of materials to help with meet ups and community events. These tutorials are aimed at the average person
rather than an avid crypto user. Consider sending these tutorials to interested parties. It can also be a good practice to use these tutorials during a Masari meetup.
